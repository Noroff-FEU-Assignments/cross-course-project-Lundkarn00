    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would advise the client to encourage strong passwords and to use two factor authentication when logging in to the website, usually with an authenticator app or by sms. HTTPS is also important for web security because it encrypts data sent between the server and clients, this makes sure that information is not easily available to attacks. It is also important to perform security exercises like mock attacks to help protect from real attacks. Implementing automatic user timeout is also a good security measure, it protects users who have left their login info in the browser for a long time. The client should also run vulnerability scans regularly to find weaknesses.</p>
